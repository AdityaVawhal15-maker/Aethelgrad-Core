 👑 Aethelgrad-Core: The Paragon Implementation

Aethelgrad-Core is the definitive, high-integrity Rust framework designed for the construction of resilient, verifiable, and hyper-scale applications. It serves as the foundational trust layer for computational mastery, leveraging the unparalleled safety and performance characteristics of the Rust language.

This project embodies a commitment to sub-millisecond determinism and uncompromising resilience, establishing a new gold standard for decentralized and high-performance system architecture.

✨ Design & Philosophy (The Core Thesis)

The architecture of Aethelgrad-Core is a direct response to the limitations of legacy systems, focusing on **computational sovereignty and verifiable execution**.

Rust Safety:** Utilizing Rust's ownership model to achieve memory safety and concurrency without compromise.
BFT Resilience:** Engineered with adaptive Byzantine Fault Tolerance (A-BFT) principles, ensuring system integrity even under duress.
Zero-Overhead Abstraction:** Modules are designed to impose near-zero runtime overhead, delivering native speed and efficiency.

 🚀 Getting Started (Sovereign Setup)

To engage with the Aethelgrad-Core, you must have the Rust toolchain properly installed.

 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have `rustup` and `cargo` installed:

```bash
# Install Rust (if not already done)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf [https://sh.rustup.rs](https://sh.rustup.rs) | sh
